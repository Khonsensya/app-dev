## My Favorite Series

One of my favorite TV series is **Bojack Horseman**. I watched it around the early pandemic, around *2021 - 2022*
It looks like your typical cartoon sitcom until it got *too real*. It tackled a lot of heavy topics, such as depression, addiction, impostor syndrome, etc.
***
Bojack Horseman is a very *complex* protagonist. He isn't someone you root for like your traditional protagonists. He is someone you want to see improve and do the right thing, but he doesn't. He makes a lot of mistakes throughout the series and is a good portrayal of a person with __mental health issues__.

Here are some of my favorite quotes from the series:
> It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day —that’s the hard part. But it does get easier

> When you look at someone with rose colored glasses all of the red flags just seem like flags

> Not understanding that you’re a horrible person doesn’t make you less of a horrible person.

> It’s never too late to be the person you want to be. You need to choose the life you want.
